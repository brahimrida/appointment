# appointment

## Implementation of an appointment app without a backend integration.

### Project status : Unfinished.

Feel free to clone and reuse the app's components. This project is a piece of a complete public portfolio of my work and a full display of my skills in the Flutter Framework.

### Note: I don't own the design, & the Figma project link will be included later in this readme.

For any adjustments to this UI, Firebase/custom back-end integration, or even a different app request, feel free to contact me directly on WhatsApp or by sending me an email:
